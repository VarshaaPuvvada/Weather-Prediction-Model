# Weather Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting weather categories (`cloudy`, `rain`, `sunrise`, `shine`) using CNN, LSTM, and Transformer architectures.

## Dataset
The dataset includes images labeled into four categories:
- Cloudy
- Rain
- Sunrise
- Shine

## Features
- Implements three model architectures:
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Transformer
- Visualizes dataset samples and predictions.

## Dependencies
Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
